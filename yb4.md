# How does Boxes4 differ from earlier versions

There are major improvements in several areas: IT environment, usability, functionality, aesthetics, reliability.

## Reliability
The application has been refined to ensure that data is held and updated in a reliable fashion. Data entered is cleaned of unwanted whitespace and forced to uppercase where necessary. Searches now find poorly entered data. Errors are positively trapped and handled correctly rather than being allowed to fail silently.

## Usability
All interfaces now behave consistently and intuitively, across all modern browsers and devices. 

Paged results can be navigated with arrow keys, page up/down or swipe left/right. In update mode, all forms now load with autofocus in the appropriate field.

Result listings can be reordered on any column. Pagesize can be varied by the user.

Because the application now consists of a single executable and a single diskfile it can be easily moved or copied to other computers for backup purposes or offline data access.

## Functionality
Searches may be limited to particular fields such as Client or Owner.

## Aesthetics
Revised colourways and font choices combined with consistent styling thoughout make this easier on the eye.

## IT environment
A single binary executable with no dependencies makes for a much simpler IT environment. The application can be easily installed and operated from cloud-based servers as well as laptops or tablets.

The GO source code of the application, needed only for development, not operations, is now organised into a coherent, consistent and highly maintainable structure within a single repository.
